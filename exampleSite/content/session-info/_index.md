**LIFESTYLE BRANDING**

A big part of your business is your brand image and your social media, and as a busy business owner, finding time to take photos constantly can be a challenge. Branding shoots take that stress away, plus give you a collection of photos to have on hand to use over a period of time!

I do not have a studio, so all branding shoots are done at an agreed upon location or your business. (Which is what I mean by the term lifestyle branding.) These are my basic packages, but I do offer some customizations depending on your goals and budget.

All shoots include:

* A pre-booking consultation to discuss pricing, location, schedule & your goals for the shoot.
* After booking or during your consultation, I will send you a questionaire about your brand or business to make sure I fully understand your vision for the shoot and your brand personality. Next is scheduling a call or in-person consultation to plan and strategize with you. We will also work together to make a digital inspiration board for the shoot, and find the perfect location(s) and props if needed.
* An online digital gallery with the option to download all images, and purchase a flash drive if desired.  If you prefer to see the whole shoot, and select your images yourself, you will get the number listed below included with your session price, and have the ability to purchase any additional favorites.
* Commercial photo release
